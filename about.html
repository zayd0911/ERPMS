                <h3>The Project... Debut</h3>
                <p>This project is part of the final year project at the University of Mauritius. It is compulsory to complete this project in order for students to graduate. Therefore, i had to either choose a project title or to come up with a proposed
                    title. I approached a lecturer with a proposed title and we had a meeting and fast foward to the end of the meeting, we concluded on 'ERP Multiplayer Simulation Game'.</p>
                <p>This project debut was on the 6th of September 2021 and is an on-going project. The 1st testing of hypothesis of the project is expected to be carried out at beginning of the second semester.</p>

                <h3>Get to know the Developer</h3>
                <p>Hi, i'm Mooradally Mohamad Zayd and i am a BSc(Hons) information Systems level 3 student. I am currently working on this web application for my final year project. The web application shall be helpful in terms of learning ERP concepts
                    by means of hands-on interaction (via simulation). I hope you enjoy the web application and get to learn something via this relatively new method of learning. Thank you all for the support. Peace!</p>
                <p>Find more details about the developer via the social bar found in the footer of this page only.</p>

                <h3>How it has been done?</h3>
                <p>The project was initially a mobile application whereby students would be ble to play the game with ease, irrespective on location. But why not have it on other platforms too? Therefore it is much better to be a web application as it can
                    be used either on computers and also on mobile devices, thus giving the users a choice.</p>
                <p>The website is fully responsive and is lightweight so as to make it easier on the hardware used to load it quickly. The application shall also be lightweight and responsive.</p>
