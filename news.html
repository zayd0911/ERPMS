                <h3>Finalisation of Project's Content</h3>
                <span>by admin / 3rd Nov, 2021</span>
                <p>After several meeting with my project supervisor, it was finally time to start on the application development. Since it is a web application, a welcome website is needed for users to obtain details of the application. The work assigned
                    was to get started with the website development and to create a link to the web application. Reports are to be compilled to start working on the main report for the final year project.</p>
                <p>The website needs to be responsive so as users can access it with ease even on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet. The website needs to be lightweight so that all devices can properly load it without too much delay. On a side
                    note; websites that takes a long time to load are frustrating to users.</p>

                <h3>Project Modification</h3>
                <span>by admin / 29th Sept, 2021</span>
                <p>The project was initially a mobile application whereby students would be able to play the game with ease, irrespective on location. But why not have it on other platforms too? Therefore it is much better to be a web application as it can
                    be used either on computers and also on mobile devices, thus giving the users a choice. Due to this, the necessary softwares had to be installed so as to build the web application.</p>
                <p>The contents of the game was discussed briefly with my supervisor and more indepth research has to be done. Development of the applicaation was not yet innitiated as further learning on the concept has to be done. We are one step closer
                    to the development stage.</p>

                <h3>Improving Knowledge on ERP</h3>
                <span>by admin / 13th Sept, 2021</span>
                <p>I have learned a lot of ERP concepts in level 2 and i knew what ERP is about. But to work on a final Year Project, even more knowledge has to be acquired and i had to research more on the subject, especially related to hands-on ERP experience.
                    My supervisor helped a lot in finding related papers on the subject. Acquiring more knowledge will definitely proves useful along the way.</p>
                <p>Learning tip: To grasp the necessary knowledge from papers and journals, it is advisable to summarise the content that interests you and also note the main points and embed them in the title of the summary so as to easily reach for it
                    whenever needed.</p>

                <h3>Project Proposal</h3>
                <span>by admin / 6th Sept, 2021</span>
                <p>ERP has been one of my subject of interest since my second year of study at the university of Mauritius. I was looking foward to work on an ERP related project which involves development and when it was time to choose a final year project
                    title, i proposed and ERP related title to the concerned lecturer for the latter to be my supervisor, and thankfully i was granted the project.</p>
                <p>The project was to be started and the concept was to build a mobile application game simulation with multiplayer support for students to get more involved by means of serious gaming. Basic hypothesis for the project is whether serious
                    games helps in learning or not.</p>
